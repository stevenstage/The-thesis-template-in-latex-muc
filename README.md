# The thesis template in latex-muc

Given the advantages of LaTeX in typesetting and writing, the Word template for undergraduate graduation design has been converted into a LaTeX template. You can directly fill in your content in test.tex.

## How to use LaTeX

There are a variety of LaTeX editors for you to choose from. Here, we mainly introduce two of the most commonly used ones:

* The first one is the Overleaf editor, which allows you to use LaTeX online and is very powerful and commonly used. Here is a [tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/ayaishere_/article/details/123332393)

* The other one is what I'm currently using: installing LaTeX locally and then integrating it into VSCode. Though a bit more involved, it's very convenient once set up. Here is a [tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/2301_78213977/article/details/145094925), [another](https://blog.csdn.net/tiao_god/article/details/108997742?ops_request_misc=%257B%2522request%255Fid%2522%253A%2522a3e686257dd6e9eb11ee59e3de0c2d80%2522%252C%2522scm%2522%253A%252220140713.130102334..%2522%257D&request_id=a3e686257dd6e9eb11ee59e3de0c2d80&biz_id=0&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduend~default-1-108997742-null-null.142^v102^control&utm_term=latex%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90%E5%88%B0vscode&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187)
