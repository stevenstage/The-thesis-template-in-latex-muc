# The thesis template in LaTeX-muc

Given the advantages of LaTeX in typesetting and writing, the Word template for undergraduate graduation design has been converted into a LaTeX template. You can directly fill in your content in thesis.tex.

## How to use LaTeX

There are a variety of LaTeX editors for you to choose from. Here, we mainly introduce two of the most commonly used ones:

* The first one is the Overleaf editor, which allows you to use LaTeX online and is very powerful and commonly used. Here is a [tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/ayaishere_/article/details/123332393)

* The other one is what I'm currently using: installing LaTeX locally and then integrating it into VSCode. Though a bit more involved, it's very convenient once set up. Here is a [tutorial in macOS](https://blog.csdn.net/2301_78213977/article/details/145094925), [another in Windows](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_37870870/article/details/122316338)

* There are certainly many other editors or methods for you to explore personally~~

I sincerely hope this information helps everyone. Feel free to leave any questions or suggestions in the issues section. Wishing everyone a smooth journey in your graduation design!
